Important cases to consider:
 - tohuvavohu: ++ has different semantics than I think you're doing here. For example, in c++, you can do: int x = 3; int y = x++; then x will equal 4 but y will be equal to 3 (the expression evaluates before x is incremented).
tohuvavohu: whereas in python y = x += 1 is invalid syntax
- tohuvavohu: Not trying to rain on your parade - keep going with your idea. I think the way to solve this in the real world is to walk through the python abstract syntax tree (AST) during compilation/interpreting which is a much more difficult problem.

TODO
[] Ignore ++/-- within comments
[] Ignore ++/-- within strings
[x] Add support of -- operator
[x] Dynamically create directories when outputting resultant .py files
[x] Handle invalid variable name being matched by REGEX pattern: 123_omar++

Completed
[x] Need to implement a Regex pattern for -- operators
[x] Parse each .py file, replace ++ with += 1, and output result to ./build directory
[x] Recursively read all files in a source directory.
